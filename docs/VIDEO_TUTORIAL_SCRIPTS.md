**[SCENE 1: Starting a Session - 0:20-1:30]**

"To start a tutoring session, click 'AI Tutor' in the main navigation.

You'll see three tutor personality options:

1. **Encouraging**: Supportive and motivating - great for building confidence

Click 'Start Session' and your AI tutor will greet you with a personalized introduction!"

**[SCENE 2: Asking Questions - 1:30-3:00]**

**Good Questions:**
- 'Can you explain the historical-grammatical method?'
- 'What's the difference between exegesis and eisegesis?'
- 'How do I identify literary genres in the Bible?'

**Less Effective:**
- 'Tell me about the Bible' (too broad)

4. Displays relevant information

You can also use voice input! Click the microphone icon and speak your question."

The AI Tutor will:
1. Generate a custom diagram
2. Display it alongside the explanation
3. Save it to your session history
4. Allow you to download it

You can also request:
- Flowcharts
- Timelines
- Comparison tables
- Mind maps
- Infographics

These visual aids are perfect for studying and note-taking!"

**[SCENE 4: Practice Quizzes - 4:15-5:30]**

"Want to test your understanding? Ask the AI Tutor to create a quiz!

Say: 'Can you create a 5-question quiz on what we just discussed?'

The AI will generate:
- Multiple choice questions
- True/false questions
- Short answer questions

Take the quiz right in the interface:
1. Answer each question
2. Submit your answers
3. Get immediate feedback
4. See explanations for correct answers
5. Review areas needing improvement

This is a great way to reinforce learning!"

**[SCENE 5: Session Management - 5:30-5:50]**

"All your tutoring sessions are saved. Click 'Session History' to:
- Review past conversations
