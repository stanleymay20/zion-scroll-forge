# ScrollUniversity Statement of Faith

## The Holy Scriptures
We believe the Bible, consisting of the Old and New Testaments, is the inspired, infallible, and authoritative Word of God. It is the supreme and final authority in all matters of faith and practice.

## The Trinity
We believe in one God, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, co-equal in nature, power, and glory.

## Jesus Christ
We believe in the deity of Jesus Christ, His virgin birth, His sinless life, His miracles, His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, His bodily resurrection, His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and His personal return in power and glory.

## The Holy Spirit
We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a godly life and to perform good works.

## Salvation
We believe that salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone. It is the free gift of God, not earned by human merit or works.

## The Church
We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ and that all true believers are members of His body, the Church.

## Resurrection and Eternal Life
We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; the saved unto eternal life and the lost unto eternal damnation.

## The Great Commission
We believe in the personal responsibility of all believers to share the Gospel with all people and to make disciples of all nations.
