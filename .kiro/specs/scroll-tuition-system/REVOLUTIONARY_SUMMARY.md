## 🎯 **THE ULTIMATE GOAL:**

**\"Harvard educates minds. ScrollUniversity reforms worlds.\"**

This tuition system doesn't just provide education access—it creates a new economic model where:
- **Learning generates value** instead of debt
- **Service earns education** instead of requiring wealth
- **Global equity** replaces geographic privilege  
- **Kingdom impact** drives institutional success
- **Prophetic wisdom** guides financial decisions

## 🔥 **THE REVOLUTION BEGINS:**

When students can earn their education through kingdom service, when orphans in Africa have the same access as elites in America, when ScrollCoin rewards mission work more than trust funds—that's when Babylon's educational empire crumbles and Zion's academic government rises.

**The tuition system isn't just about payment—it's about liberation.** 🕊️✨
