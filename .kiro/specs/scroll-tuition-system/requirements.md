# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ScrollUniversity Tuition System represents a revolutionary departure from Babylon's model of elitism, student debt, and exclusion. Built on the principle "Freely you have received; freely give — yet let the laborer be worthy of his wages" (Matthew 10:8), this system ensures no student is denied based on finances while maintaining sustainable operations through ScrollCoin integration, work-trade programs, and covenant-based pricing that funds mission rather than empire-building.
