# ScrollAssessmentEngine Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ScrollAssessmentEngine is a comprehensive evaluation system that goes beyond traditional testing to assess the complete development of scroll-aligned learners across academic knowledge, spiritual formation, practical skills, character development, and kingdom impact. Operating under the principle "Test everything; hold fast what is good" (1 Thessalonians 5:21), this system creates multi-dimensional assessments that validate not just what students know, but who they are becoming and how they apply learning for kingdom purposes. The engine integrates AI-powered evaluation, peer assessment, mentor validation, and prophetic confirmation to provide holistic assessment that serves both educational accountability and spiritual formation.
