# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ScrollCritical Thinking & Innovation Engine represents the revolutionary core of ScrollUniversity's educational methodology. Built on the principle "Come, let us reason together" (Isaiah 1:18), this system transforms education from Babylon's "what to think" model to Zion's "how to discern" approach. The engine integrates prophetic reasoning with data discernment, creating students who don't just quote theories but build systems, challenge empires, and govern nations through Spirit-led critical thinking and divine innovation.

## Requirements
