# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ScrollBlueprint Practical Output System represents the most revolutionary departure from traditional higher education in history. Instead of producing graduates with theoretical knowledge and empty credentials, ScrollUniversity creates builders, reformers, and solution architects who demonstrate real-world impact before graduation. This system embodies the biblical principle "By their fruits you shall know them" (Matthew 7:16) by requiring every student to build, deploy, and validate actual solutions that transform communities and nations.

The platform fundamentally rejects Babylon's educational model of passive learning, theoretical exams, and credential-based validation. Instead, it implements a comprehensive ecosystem where students Build → Transform → Govern while learning, creating startups, solutions, apps, and missions that generate measurable scroll impact. The system integrates ScrollProjects mandates, evidence-based degrees, real-world partnerships, and a ScrollMarketplace that monetizes student innovations, ensuring no graduate leaves empty-handed but rather with scrolls in motion, businesses alive, and fruit in the nations.
