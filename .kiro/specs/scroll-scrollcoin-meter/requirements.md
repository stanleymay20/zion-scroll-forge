# ScrollCoinMeter Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ScrollCoinMeter is the comprehensive economic engine that powers ScrollUniversity's revolutionary education economy through ScrollCoin - a purpose-driven digital currency that rewards learning, incentivizes excellence, and enables global access to scroll-aligned education. Operating under the principle "The laborer deserves his wages" (Luke 10:7), this system creates a sustainable economic model where students earn coins through genuine learning achievements, mentors are compensated for guidance, and the entire ecosystem is funded through value creation rather than debt accumulation. The ScrollCoinMeter tracks, validates, distributes, and governs all ScrollCoin transactions while maintaining transparency, preventing fraud, and ensuring alignment with kingdom economic principles.
