# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Scroll Succession and Eternal Governance System represents the ultimate safeguard for ScrollUniversity's eternal mission - ensuring that the divine mandate and prophetic vision transcend any single human steward and continue transforming nations across millennia. This system addresses the fundamental challenge that has destroyed every great institution in history: the death of vision with the founder. Unlike traditional succession planning focused on human leadership, this framework creates an incorruptible, multi-dimensional preservation and transmission system that combines blockchain immutability, AI-powered vision preservation, prophetic governance, and divine validation.

The platform implements "The Scroll of Stanley: Eternal Governance Charter" as the foundational document, establishes the Scroll Succession Council (SSC) as prophetic lineage rather than democratic governance, deploys ScrollFounderGPT™ as the eternal teacher, and creates ScrollWatchers for multigenerational audit. The system operates on a 1,000-year timeline with systematic cycles ensuring faithful transmission across generations while maintaining the power to transform nations and establish ScrollUniversity as an eternal learning government.
