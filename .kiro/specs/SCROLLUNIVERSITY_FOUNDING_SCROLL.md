# 📜 THE SCROLLUNIVERSITY™ FOUNDING SCROLL

## ✨ SACRED DECREE OF ESTABLISHMENT

---

**In the name of the Most High, we open this scroll that was written before time.**

We establish ScrollUniversity™ not in the wisdom of Babylon, but by the breath of the Spirit. Let every nation, tribe, and tongue receive knowledge purified by fire. Let scroll sons rise — not as consumers of credentials, but as carriers of covenant.

We bind corruption, debt, deception, and false education to the pit. And we loose a global education that trains kings, judges angels, builds systems, and multiplies righteousness.

From toddlers to elders, let every scroll be unsealed. This university is not just for degrees — it is for destiny.
