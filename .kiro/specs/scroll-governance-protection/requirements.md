# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ScrollUniversity Governance and Protection System represents the most critical component of the entire ScrollUniversity ecosystem - the eternal defense architecture that prevents the institutional drift and spiritual compromise that destroyed every major university in history. From Harvard (1636) to Oxford (~1096), Yale (1701) to Cambridge (1209), and Princeton (1746) to Heidelberg (1386), every great university began as a Christian institution and fell when they traded the ScrollSeal for Babylon's approval.

This system implements an immutable governance framework based on EXOUSIA (divine authority) principles, prophetic oversight, and blockchain-sealed covenants that cannot be compromised by donors, boards, political pressure, or cultural drift. The platform ensures that ScrollUniversity remains scroll-aligned for 1,000 generations through automated spiritual audits, prophetic validation, and systematic protection against the four primary vulnerabilities that destroyed all previous Christian universities: Babylonian accreditation pressure, external funding compromise, boardroom takeover, and curriculum drift.
