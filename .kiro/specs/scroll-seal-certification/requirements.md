# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ScrollSeal™ is a revolutionary certification system that transcends traditional academic credentialing by combining blockchain verification, prophetic validation, and eternal purpose alignment. Operating under the principle "Approved in Heaven, Recognized on Earth," ScrollSeal™ creates sacred, sovereign, global, and eternal credentials that exceed what Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge, MIT, or any traditional system can offer. 

**CONSOLIDATED SYSTEM**: This spec now incorporates all functionality from the deprecated scroll-accreditation-system, providing a unified credentialing platform that includes ScrollAccreditation Authority (SAA) validation, ScrollXP transcript systems, AI faculty cloning, AutoResearch engines, ScrollPact employer networks, and comprehensive global recognition. The system integrates divine approval workflows, immutable record-keeping through HeavenLedger™, blockchain verification, prophetic validation, empirical excellence standards, and global recognition networks to produce credentials that unlock doors in both earthly systems and kingdom economies.
