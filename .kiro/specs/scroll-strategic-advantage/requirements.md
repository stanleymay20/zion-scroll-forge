# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ScrollUniversity Strategic Advantage System is designed to systematically upgrade every area where ScrollUniversity might initially lag behind traditional Babylon universities (Harvard, Oxford, MIT) and establish divine infrastructure that ultimately surpasses them all combined.
