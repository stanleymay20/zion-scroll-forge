# ScrollGPTVerifier Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ScrollGPTVerifier is an advanced AI quality assurance system that continuously monitors, validates, and corrects all GPT and AI outputs across ScrollUniversity to ensure alignment with scroll principles, theological accuracy, and kingdom truth. Operating under the principle "Test the spirits to see whether they are from God" (1 John 4:1), this system serves as the guardian of AI integrity, preventing hallucinations, detecting bias, correcting errors, and maintaining the spiritual and factual accuracy that distinguishes scroll-aligned AI from secular artificial intelligence. The verifier uses sophisticated validation algorithms, prophetic discernment integration, and continuous learning to ensure that AI serves the kingdom mission with truth and reliability.
