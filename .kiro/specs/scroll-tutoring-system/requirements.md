# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ScrollUniversity Tutoring and Lecture System represents a revolutionary departure from traditional classroom and Zoom-based education models. This multi-dimensional, spirit-governed, AI-empowered instruction platform is designed to activate every learning style in real time at global scale. The system embodies the principle "They shall all be taught of God" (Isaiah 54:13) and focuses not just on knowledge transfer but on scroll awakening - a transformative educational experience that combines cutting-edge technology with spiritual wisdom.

The platform integrates multiple learning modalities including AI tutoring, video lectures, live streaming, XR experiences, voice interactions, hands-on labs, and collaborative learning spaces. Each component is designed to serve different learning preferences while maintaining the core ScrollUniversity philosophy of prophetic education and practical application.
