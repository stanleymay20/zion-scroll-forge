# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ScrollAccreditation and Recognition System represents a paradigm-shifting approach to educational validation and global recognition. Unlike traditional accreditation bodies that focus solely on institutional compliance, the ScrollAccreditation Authority (SAA) establishes a new standard that integrates divine revelation, empirical excellence, and real-world impact. This system creates its own ecosystem of validation, research, faculty development, and employer partnerships that transcends conventional educational boundaries.

The platform operates on four core pillars: Revelation Integrity (alignment with divine scrolls), Empirical Excellence (verifiable and reproducible data), Nation Impact (solving real-world challenges), and Scroll Seal (joint validation by prophets and data scientists). The system produces blockchain-verified ScrollTranscripts that include traditional metrics alongside innovation scores, prophetic defense outcomes, and community impact measurements.
