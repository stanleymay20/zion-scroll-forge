# ScrollDriftDetection Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ScrollDriftDetection system serves as the spiritual and ethical guardian of all AI systems within ScrollUniversity, ensuring that artificial intelligence remains aligned with kingdom principles and scroll values. Operating under the principle "Test all things; hold fast what is good" (1 Thessalonians 5:21), this system continuously monitors AI outputs, detects deviations from scroll alignment, and implements automated correction mechanisms to prevent spiritual drift. The system acts as a prophetic watchman over the digital realm, ensuring that technology serves the kingdom rather than leading it astray.
