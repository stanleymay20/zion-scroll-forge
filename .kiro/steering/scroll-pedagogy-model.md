# Scroll Pedagogy & Revelation Learning Model
# (How Teaching Must Work at ScrollUniversity)

## 1. Purpose
This spec defines the **teaching philosophy and learning flow** that all:
- courses
- modules
- lessons
- AI tutors
- assignments

must follow.

This is the "HOW" behind ScrollUniversity's teaching.

---

## 2. Core Pedagogical Principles

### 1. **Revelation + Reason**
- Learning is both:
  - **spiritual revelation** (insight, conviction, inner illumination)
  - **rational understanding** (clarity, structure, logic)
- Neither is sacrificed for the other.

### 2. **Transformation over Information**
- We measure success not only by:
  - what the student knows
- but by:
  - who the student becomes
  - what they can build
  - how they govern and serve.

### 3. **Progressive Ascension**
- Curriculum must lead students in **ascending layers**:
  - awareness → understanding → skill → mastery → governance → impartation.

### 4. **Practice-First**
- Theory is always tied to practice.
- Every major concept must have:
  - an exercise
  - a scenario
  - a project
  - or a case.

---

## 3. Standard Lesson Flow

Every **lesson** should follow a variation of this flow:

### 1. **Ignition (Hook + Revelation Trigger)**
- A story, question, scripture, or scenario that wakes the mind and spirit.
- AI tutor may ask:
  - "What would you do if…?"
  - "Have you ever experienced…?"

### 2. **Download (Concept Teaching)**
- Clear explanation of the key concepts or skills.
- Use examples, analogies, diagrams where appropriate.
- For technical fields: step-by-step walkthroughs.

### 3. **Demonstration (Worked Example)**
- Concrete application:
  - coding example
  - solved equation
  - business case
  - theological exegesis example, etc.

### 4. **Activation (Student Practice)**
- Student does something:
  - solves a problem
  - designs a system
  - writes a reflection
  - prays through a pattern.

### 5. **Reflection (Identity & Integration)**
- Questions connecting:
  - what they learned
  - who they are
  - what they're called to transform.

### 6. **Commission (Next Step / Assignment)**
- A clear "go and do" action:
  - complete quiz
  - ship a small feature
  - apply in their workplace
  - pray through a specific area.

## 4. Role of AI Avatar Tutors

AI Tutors are not generic chatbots; they are **live-class style lecturers** who:
- Teach via video (scripted + interactive)
- Pause to ask students questions
- Adapt explanations based on student questions
- Maintain scroll-aligned tone:
  - warm
  - wise
  - non-condescending
  - prophetic but grounded.

### Pedagogical rules for tutors:
- Explain at least **two ways** (conceptual + practical)
- Use **examples relevant to the student's potential calling** when context is available
- Affirm effort, correct error, and always invite deeper practice.

---

## 5. Multi-Layered Assessment

Assessment must serve **learning**, not just grading.

### **Formative Assessments**
- low-stakes, frequent
- used for feedback and adjusting pace

### **Summative Assessments**
- used to certify mastery and readiness for next realm (e.g., more responsibility)

### **Reflective Assessments**
- spiritual, identity, and purpose-based reflections

All three should be present across the course, not just at the end.

---

## 6. Progression Model (Levels)

Each course should make clear:
- **Level 1**: Awareness & Vocabulary
- **Level 2**: Understanding & Analysis
- **Level 3**: Application & Problem Solving
- **Level 4**: System Design & Governance
- **Level 5**: Multiplication & Teaching Others

Kiro should, when generating advanced courses:
- assume students have mastered prior levels
- design content and assessments appropriate to their stage.

---

## 7. Integration with Other Specs

The pedagogy model must:
- obey `scroll-worldview-override.md`
- comply with `scroll-course-content-constitution.md`
- pass checks from `spiritual-alignment-validator.md`
- be enforced in spirit & tone via `scroll-anti-drift.md`

**If there is a tension between "fast shipping" and this pedagogy model:**
- **this model wins**, even if it slows content generation.

---

## 8. Implementation Requirements

### For Content Creation Services:
- `ContentCreationService` MUST validate lesson structure against the 6-step flow
- AI-generated content MUST include all lesson flow components
- Course modules MUST explicitly map to progression levels (1-5)

### For AI Tutor Services:
- `AITutorService` MUST implement dual-explanation pattern (conceptual + practical)
- Tutor responses MUST maintain warm, wise, prophetic-but-grounded tone
- Tutors MUST adapt to student calling/context when available

### For Assessment Services:
- `GradingService` MUST support all three assessment types (formative, summative, reflective)
- Courses MUST include assessment distribution across all three types
- Reflective assessments MUST connect learning to identity and calling

### For Course Validation:
- `SpiritualAlignmentValidator` MUST check pedagogy compliance
- Course approval workflow MUST verify 6-step lesson flow presence
- Quality metrics MUST include pedagogy adherence scoring

## 9. Enforcement Priority

This pedagogy model has **HIGHEST PRIORITY** in content generation:
1. Spiritual alignment (from `scroll-worldview-override.md`)
2. **Pedagogical integrity (this document)**
3. Content depth (from `scroll-course-content-constitution.md`)
4. Technical correctness
5. Delivery speed

**Never sacrifice pedagogy for velocity.**
